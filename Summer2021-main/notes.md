I dont like the current state of the smart contract. Overloaded. Have to crimp it down. Also need to make it industrial strength,
For example delay in AirNode is unacceptable for DEX. Also consideration for Market impact etc.

of exchange of electronic assets in traditional finance, they are challenging to use within
a smart contract environment." [An Analysis of Uniswap Markets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03380.pdf)

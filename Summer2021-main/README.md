# Summer2021
This repository is for **blockchain** projects designed and develped in summer 2021.

The first project is **Oraclizing APIs** using AirNode.

This project is developed in six phases: starting off with AirNode start up code.

Issues: 
 - bytes32 to int256 conversion
 - Any problem with config json files takes a long time to debug. No easy way to figure if anything is incorrect with config files.versions 
 - AirNode uses Solidity 6.0 and if we use other higher versions in our development, it throws errors that are hard to debug.
 - Using hardhat will help?
 - Ether.js seems to be stable than web3.js (but it is simple)
